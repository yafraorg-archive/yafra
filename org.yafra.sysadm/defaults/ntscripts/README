Windows scripts for yafra.org, 2002, Switzerland
=======================================

To work with our classic environment under Windows NT or higher you need
to install the GNU Cygwin utilities from www.cygwin.com. (deselect perl if
you have installed ActiveState Perl and check that ActiveState Perl is
in your PATH)

* PROFILE for cygwin BASH

1) install all Cygwin tools and X11 with development

2) make a copy of $PISOTOOLS/defaults/profile to $HOME/.profile on your
   NT - check that HOME is correctly defined !! (UNIX style)

3) edit your new .profile file to your settings
   You have 3 options at the beginning of .profile
   - cygwin environment - generates/compiles with cygwin support (UNIX emulation)
   - mingw environment - generates/compiles with GCC but in Win32 NATIVE (no UNIX emu)
   - VisualStudio - generates/compiles with pure MS Visual C/C++
   You have to uncomment one of them and with our standard makefiles it will
   compile like you want

4) start a bash

that's it.

* makeversion

DON'T TOUCH THIS FILE ! It's a shell (bash) script for our version
handling ! It's called by makefiles !


cheers, Martin
